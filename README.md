stockscrape
===========

**Version**: 1.3, 20130225

**Author**: David Prager Branner


Goal
----
To explore web scraping using the headline news service on (finance.yahoo.com).

Principal Contents
------------------

`stockscrape.py`: Version for Python 3.2 only. This is the principal scraping program.

`headline_length.py`: Trimmed version for determining the longest attested headline, link, and news-source, in preparation for creating database fields. Default list of stock tickers is the same as for `stockscrape.py`; several others are found in `DATA/`.

`OUTPUT/`: where output file, `stock_report.tex` is saved. Note that this file needs to be compiled with LaTeX in order to be usable. The LaTeX output file `stock_report.pdf` will normally be found here as well.

`CODE/`: contains `.tex` templates for beginning and end of output file.

`DATA/`: contains `.txt` file of stock tickers to be looked up, one per line.

`PREVIOUS_VERSIONS/`: previous versions will be stored here with date appended, but they may not run as is because directory structures have changed. See past commits of the repository for complete working installations of these older versions.

Notes
-----

Output of `stockscrape.py` contains first a table of stock prices and related data, from the Yahoo API, followed by a list of recent headlines for each stock ticker. The output is a `.tex` file, while must be compiled to produce human-readlable output. The LaTeX package `longtable` is used, to allow breaking of tables across pages if they exceed the amount of available space on the first page.

This version scrapes the Yahoo financial news site using Beautiful Soup 4.
